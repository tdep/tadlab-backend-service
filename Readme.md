# TADLAB Backend Service API
This is the backend service for my portfolio site and other projects.
Eventually, it will be expanded to serve as the basis for exciting coding projects
like synthesizers and shiny things :D

Currently, the service is written in Java using SpringBoot with a database in PostgreSQL.
I'm presently following the model of BFF, so this service actually serves the companion 
API for the portfolio site which in turn serves the frontend directly.
